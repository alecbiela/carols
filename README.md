# Carols

A simple viewer app for sing-along Christmas carols.

A few notes:

- The viewer is developed using Alpine.js.
- The content is stored in a JSON file, pulled on page load.
- An editor to modify the content of the JSON will be built using Alpine and Quill (coming soon).
- The app is hosted using Cloudflare Workers, developed using Wrangler.

Additional Documentation is forthcoming.
